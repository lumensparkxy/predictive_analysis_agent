# Snowflake Predictive Analytics & Cost Optimization System

A comprehensive data analytics system that monitors, predicts, and optimizes Snowflake database usage and costs using machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent decision-making.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast Snowflake usage patterns, cost trends, and potential system issues
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically identify and implement cost-saving opportunities  
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect anomalies and potential failures before they impact operations
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Use LLMs to provide context-aware alerts with actionable insights
- **Automated Actions**: Implement automated responses to optimize performance and reduce costs
