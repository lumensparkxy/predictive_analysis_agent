cd predictive_analysis_agent

# 2. Run deployment script
chmod +x deployment/production/scripts/deploy.sh
./deployment/production/scripts/deploy.sh

# 3. Configure environment
cp deployment/production/environment/production.env config/
cp deployment/production/environment/secrets.env config/
# Edit configuration files with your settings

# 4. Start services
sudo systemctl start analytics-api analytics-worker analytics-scheduler nginx

# 5. Verify deployment
