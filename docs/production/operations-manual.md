## Daily Operations

### Morning Checklist (Start of Business Day)
1. **System Health Verification**
   ```bash
   curl https://analytics.yourcompany.com/health
   ./deployment/production/scripts/health-check.sh
   ```

2. **Service Status Check**
   ```bash
   systemctl status analytics-api analytics-worker analytics-scheduler nginx postgresql redis
   ```

3. **Resource Usage Review**
   - CPU usage < 70%
   - Memory usage < 80%
   - Disk usage < 85%
   - Check via monitoring dashboard or `htop`

4. **Log Review**
   ```bash
   # Check for errors in application logs
   tail -100 /opt/analytics/logs/application.log | grep -i error
   
   # Check nginx access logs for unusual patterns
   tail -100 /var/log/nginx/analytics_access.log
   ```

5. **Backup Verification**
   - Verify last night's backup completed successfully
   - Check backup file exists and size is reasonable
   ```bash
   ls -la /opt/analytics/backups/ | head -5
   ```

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Monitor alerts in Slack #analytics-alerts channel

### End of Day Checklist
1. Review daily metrics and performance
2. Check any alerts or incidents from the day
3. Verify all services are running normally
4. Ensure backup schedule is on track
