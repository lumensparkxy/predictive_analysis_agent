## Configuration

### Feature Store Configuration
```python
from src.snowflake_analytics.feature_store import FeatureStoreConfig

config = FeatureStoreConfig(
    # Storage settings
    storage_backend="parquet",
    storage_path="data/feature_store",
    compression="snappy",
    partitioning_columns=["year", "month"],
    
    # Online store
    online_store_uri="redis://localhost:6379",
    cache_ttl_seconds=3600,
    
    # Performance
    max_parallel_operations=10,
    enable_caching=True,
    
    # Features
    enable_lineage=True,
    enable_monitoring=True,
    retention_days=365
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Operations

```python
from src.snowflake_analytics.feature_store import FeatureStore, FeatureType

# Initialize feature store
with FeatureStore(config=config) as store:
    
    # Register feature
    metadata = store.register_feature(
        name="user_age",
        description="User age in years", 
        feature_type=FeatureType.NUMERICAL,
        data_type="integer",
        feature_group="demographics",
        created_by="data_engineer"
    )
    
    # Write features
    result = store.write_features(
        feature_data=df,
        feature_group="demographics",
        mode="append"
    )
    
    # Read features
    features = store.read_features(
        feature_group="demographics",
        features=["user_age", "user_country"],
        limit=1000
    )
```

### Online Feature Serving

```python
# Get features for real-time inference
online_features = store.get_online_features(
    feature_group="demographics",
    entity_ids=["user_1", "user_2", "user_3"],
    features=["user_age", "user_country"]
)

# Result format:
# {
#   "user_1": {"user_age": 25, "user_country": "US"},
#   "user_2": {"user_age": 34, "user_country": "UK"},
#   "user_3": {"user_age": 42, "user_country": "CA"}
# }
```

### Feature Quality Monitoring

```python
# Compute statistics
stats = store.compute_feature_statistics(
    feature_group="demographics",
    features=["user_age", "user_country"]
)

# Validate quality
validation = store.validate_feature_quality(
    feature_group="demographics",
    quality_rules={
        "max_missing_percentage": 5.0,
        "min_unique_values": 2,
        "max_outlier_percentage": 3.0
    }
)
```

### Feature Lineage and Impact Analysis

```python
# Get feature lineage
lineage = store.get_feature_lineage(
    feature_id="user_age",
    direction="both",
    depth=3
)

# Analyze impact of changes
impact = store.analyze_impact(
    feature_id="user_age",
    change_type="schema_change"
)
```

## Integration with ML Pipelines

### Training Pipeline Integration

```python
def train_model():
    with FeatureStore(config=config) as store:
        # 1. Feature selection and validation
        features = store.read_features(
            feature_group="user_features",
            start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=90)
        )
        
        # 2. Quality validation
        quality_check = store.validate_feature_quality("user_features")
        if not quality_check['overall_passed']:
            raise ValueError("Feature quality validation failed")
        
        # 3. Create training snapshot
        snapshot_id = store.create_feature_snapshot(
            feature_group="user_features",
            snapshot_name=f"training_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}",
            description="Training dataset snapshot",
            created_by="ml_pipeline"
        )
        
        # 4. Train model with snapshot data
        return train_ml_model(features)
```

### Inference Pipeline Integration

```python
def predict(user_ids):
    with FeatureStore(config=config) as store:
        # Get real-time features
        features = store.get_online_features(
            feature_group="user_features",
            entity_ids=user_ids,
            features=["age", "country", "income"]
