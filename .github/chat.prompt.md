connect to my github repo using mcp

> Copilot: I'll help you connect to your GitHub repository and set up the Snowflake predictive analytics project as outlined in your prompt file. Let me start by getting information about your current repository and then create the comprehensive project structure. Great! I can see you're connected as `lumensparkxy`. Now let me check the details of your current repository: Let me try a different approach to see the repository structure: Let me check if there are any existing files in the repository: Perfect! I can see that your `predictive_analysis_agent` repository exists but is currently empty. Based on your initial_talk.prompt.md file, I'll now create the comprehensive project structure for your Snowflake predictive analytics system.

i cannot use   
redis: # Caching and real-time data. 
can we do without it. 

also i have azure sql database (im not sure if this is postgresql) 
this is the connection link to it. 
we can use this one for metadata collection 
Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:testerx.database.windows.net,1433;Database=testerdb;Uid=testerx;Pwd={your_password_here};Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=no;Connection Timeout=30;

> Copilot: Perfect! Let me update the infrastructure plan to work without Redis and use your Azure SQL Database instead. Azure SQL Database is Microsoft's cloud database service (based on SQL Server, not PostgreSQL), so we'll adjust accordingly.
> 
> Let me add a comment to Issue #1 with the updated requirements: Perfect! I've updated Issue #1 with your specific requirements. Here's a summary of the key changes:
> 
> ## 🔄 **Updated Infrastructure Plan**
> 
> ### **✅ What We're Using:**
> - **Azure SQL Database** (your existing database)
> - **Simplified Docker setup** (no Redis needed)
> - **Python-based caching** (in-memory and file-based)
> 
> ### **❌ What We're Removing:**
> - **Redis** dependency
> - **PostgreSQL** setup
> - Complex caching infrastructure
> 
> ## 🎯 **Key Benefits of This Approach:**
> 
> ### **1. Cost-Effective**
> - Use your existing Azure SQL Database
> - No additional Redis hosting costs
> - Simpler infrastructure = lower maintenance
> 
> ### **2. Simplified Architecture**
> ```

> ```
> 
> ### **3. Performance Strategy Without Redis**
> - **In-Memory Caching**: For frequently accessed data (configurations, recent queries)
> - **File-Based Caching**: For expensive computations and model results
> - **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization in Azure SQL
> - **Smart Data Loading**: Incremental loads and pagination
> 
> ## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
> 
> ### **Database Connection**
> ```python
> # Connection string for Azure SQL
> connection_string = (
>     "Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};"
>     "Server=tcp:testerx.database.windows.net,1433;"
>     "Database=testerdb;"
>     "Uid=testerx;"
>     "Pwd={password};"
>     "Encrypt=yes;"
>     "TrustServerCertificate=no;"
>     "Connection Timeout=30;"
> )
> ```
> 
> ### **Caching Strategy**
> ```python
> # In-memory caching for config
> @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
> def get_config(): ...
> 
> # File-based caching for models
> @memory.cache
> def train_model(data): ...
> 
> # Time-based caching
> cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=300)
> ```

> 
> ## ⚡ **Performance Expectations**
> Without Redis, we'll achieve good performance through:
> - **Database connection pooling**
> - **Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing**
> - **Smart in-memory caching** for hot data
> - **File-based caching** for expensive operations
> - **Optimized data loading patterns**
> 
> This approach will work excellently for your Snowflake predictive analytics system while leveraging your existing Azure infrastructure and keeping the architecture simple and maintainable!

also for the timebeing i do not want to use docker containerization 
but may be later 

> Copilot: Perfect! Let me update Issue #1 to remove Docker containerization for now. This will make the setup even simpler and faster to get started. Perfect! I've updated Issue #1 to remove Docker containerization for now. This makes the setup much simpler and faster to get started.

can we also do without sql database.. 
metadata storage can be local filebased 

> Copilot: Absolutely! Let's simplify even further by removing the SQL database dependency and using local file-based storage. This will make the setup extremely simple and portable. Perfect! Now we have the **ultimate simplified architecture** with absolutely minimal dependencies. Let me also update the issue title to reflect this final ultra-simple approach: Excellent! 🎉 Now we have the **ultimate simplified architecture** for your Snowflake predictive analytics system:
> 
> ## 🎯 **What We Achieved**
> 
> ### **✅ Ultra-Simple Setup:**
> - **No Redis** → Local file caching with `diskcache`
> - **No Azure SQL Database** → SQLite for metadata + JSON for config
> - **No Docker** → Local Python virtual environment
> - **Minimal Dependencies** → Only essential Python packages
> 
> ### **🚀 2-Minute Setup Process:**
> ```bash
> git clone <repo>
> cd snowflake_predictive_analytics
> python scripts/setup.py
> # Edit config/snowflake.json with your credentials
> python main.py
> # Done! 🎉
> ```
> 
> ### **📂 Storage Strategy:**
> - **SQLite** → Metadata, logs, model metrics (lightweight database)
> - **JSON** → Configuration files (version controlled)
> - **Parquet** → Time-series data from Snowflake (efficient columnar storage)
> - **Local Cache** → File-based caching for performance
> 
> ### **🛠️ Key Benefits:**
> - ✅ **Zero Infrastructure**: No external services needed
> - ✅ **Maximum Portability**: Copy folder = full migration
> - ✅ **Easy Debugging**: Direct file access
> - ✅ **Cost Effective**: No hosting costs
> - ✅ **Self-Contained**: Everything runs locally
> - ✅ **Scalable**: Can add cloud storage/databases later
> 
> ## 🚀 **Ready to Start Implementation**
> 
> Issue #1 is now fully planned with your exact requirements:
> - **File-based storage only**
> - **No external databases**
> - **Ultra-simple deployment**
> - **Maximum portability**
> 
> This approach gives you all the power of the predictive analytics system while being incredibly simple to set up and maintain. When you're ready to scale, we can easily add cloud storage, databases, or containers - but for now, you have a lean, efficient system that works perfectly for development and initial deployment.
> 
> Would you like me to start implementing Issue #1 with this ultra-simplified architecture, or do you have any other adjustments you'd like to make first?

can we run the project now

> Copilot: Yes! Let's run the project now. Since we have the complete infrastructure set up, let's first run the automated setup script to ensure everything is properly configured, then test the main application. Great! The setup completed successfully. Now let's activate the virtual environment and test the main application: Perfect! Now let's check the project status to verify everything is working: Good! The system is mostly operational. We have a pyarrow version compatibility warning with Snowflake connector. Let's check what commands are available and then try to start the server: Perfect! Now let's start the web server to see the application running: Let's check the output of the server startup: Let me try starting the server with the correct Python path in the virtual environment: I see the issue! We need to create the FastAPI application module that the main.py is trying to import. Let me create the missing API module: We also need to add psutil to our requirements for system metrics. Let me update the requirements file: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now let's install the missing psutil package: Great! Now let's try starting the server again: Excellent! 🎉 The server is now running successfully! Let's open the dashboard in a browser to see it in action: Perfect! Let's also test the API endpoints to make sure they're working: Let's also check the system status endpoint: I need to add the missing `get_stats` method to the SQLiteStore. Let me fix this: Let me find the end of the file to add the get_stats method: I can see there's already a `get_database_stats` method, but the API is calling `get_stats`. Let me add an alias method: 
> ````
> 
> ````
> Now let's test the API status endpoint again: The server needs to reload. Let me restart it: The port is still in use. Let me try with a different port: Let me check the main.py to see if it supports port configuration: Good, it does support port configuration. Let me kill the existing process and restart:
