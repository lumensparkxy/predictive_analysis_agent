I have snowflake database.
I need to conduct some predictive analysis on its usage and costs. 
and then use LLMs to predict events and alert / take action so that we can save costs and outage or failures


give me project structure and workflow. 
also give explaination
do not code

> ## Project Brief: Snowflake Database Predictive Analytics & Cost Optimization System
> 
> ### Project Overview
> I need to build a comprehensive data analytics system that monitors, predicts, and optimizes Snowflake database usage and costs. The system should use machine learning for predictive analytics and integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent decision-making, automated alerting, and cost-saving actions.
> 
> ### Core Objectives

> 
> #### Predictive Capabilities Needed
> - **Usage Forecasting**: Predict query volumes, peak usage times, resource requirements
> - **Cost Prediction**: Project monthly/quarterly expenses, identify budget overruns
> - **Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual patterns in performance, costs, or user behavior
> - **Failure Prediction**: Anticipate system issues and performance degradations
> 
> #### LLM Integration Requirements
> - Analyze complex patterns and provide business context to technical metrics
> - Generate human-readable insights and explanations for predictions
> - Make intelligent decisions about alert severity and appropriate responses
> - Create natural language summaries of system status and recommendations
> 
> #### Automation & Actions

> - **Cost Controls**: Suspend idle resources, optimize query execution plans
> - **Maintenance Scheduling**: Schedule maintenance during low-usage periods
> - **Alert Management**: Smart routing of notifications based on severity and context
> 
> ### Technology Stack Preferences
> - **Primary Language**: Python
> - **Data Processing**: Pandas/Polars for data manipulation
> - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch for modeling
> - **Time Series**: Prophet or similar for forecasting

> - **Visualization**: Grafana or Streamlit for dashboards
> - **Infrastructure**: Docker for containerization
> - **Storage**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching
> 
> ### Project Structure Requirements
> The project should be organized with clear separation of concerns:
> - Configuration management for different environments
> - Modular data collection components
> - Separate modules for different types of predictive models
> - Clean LLM integration layer with prompt templates
> - Flexible alerting system with multiple notification channels
> - Automated action modules with safety controls
> - Comprehensive testing and monitoring
> 
> ### Success Criteria
> - Achieve 85%+ accuracy in usage and cost predictions
> - Reduce Snowflake costs by 20-30% through optimization
> - Decrease manual intervention in system management by 70%
> - Provide actionable insights within 5 minutes of anomaly detection
> - Maintain system uptime above 99.5%
> 
> ### Constraints & Considerations
> - Must handle sensitive financial and usage data securely
> - Should integrate with existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure
> - Need to balance automation with human oversight for critical decisions
> - Must be scalable to handle multiple Snowflake accounts
> - Should provide audit trails for all automated actions
> 
> ### Deliverables Expected
> - Complete project setup with proper folder structure
> - Data collection and processing pipelines
> - Trained predictive models with validation metrics
> - LLM integration with decision-making capabilities
> - Automated alerting and action systems
> - Monitoring dashboards and reporting tools
> - Documentation and deployment guides
> - Testing frameworks and CI/CD pipeline setup
> 
> ### Additional Context
> This system will be used by a data engineering team to manage multiple Snowflake environments across development, staging, and production. The team needs both technical alerts for immediate issues and strategic insights for long-term planning. The system should learn from historical patterns and continuously improve its predictions and recommendations.

> Please create a detailed task breakdown that covers all aspects of building this system, from initial setup through deployment and monitoring. Include specific tasks for data exploration, model development, LLM integration, testing, and deployment. Organize tasks by priority and dependencies, and estimate effort levels for each task.
